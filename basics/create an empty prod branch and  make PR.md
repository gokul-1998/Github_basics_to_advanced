- lets say you want to raise a PR from your dev to a new branch namely `prod`
  - ` git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`
      - use this command to get  the hash of the first commit
  - `git checkout hash`
  - `git checkout -b production`
  - `git push origin`

- now raise a PR from dev to this newly created Prod.
